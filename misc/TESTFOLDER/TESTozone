# tag could also be assigned the value "nan" (not a number) to invoke 
# computation of azimuth-independent irradiances and azimuthally 
# averaged radiances. This choice will increase the computational 
# speed significantly, because in the nadir or zenith direction the

#
# The REPEATED_RUN_SIZE tag shall be assigned an integer larger than

# File value assignment:
# Specify the name of the text file, which must end with .txt, for
# example like this:
#
# SOURCE_ZENITH_ANGLE = source_zenith_angle.txt 
#
# The values in the source_zenith_angle.txt file should be in separate
# rows. A new row will then be read for each run. The reading will 
# continue from the top of the file if the repeated run size is larger 
# than the number of rows. The input text files should be stored in
# the same folder as the configuration files.
#
# Random assignment:
# A randomly drawn number can be assigned by specifying the distribution and
# limits enclosed in square brackets. For example:
#
# SOURCE_SCALING_FACTOR = [uniformly distributed from 0.9 to 1.1]
# or
# SOURCE_SCALING_FACTOR = [logarithmically distributed from 0.9 to 1.1]
#
# It is also possible to have randomly drawn numbers in a list, e.g.
#
# DETECTOR_WAVELENGTHS = 400 [uniformly distributed from 500 to 600] 700
#
# New values will be drawn for each repeated run, in accordance with
# the given probability distribution. Currently, "uniformly" and
# "loguniformly" are the only distributions implemented.
#
# The output radiometric quantities are appended to their output
# files at each run. And for random assignment the drawn values are
# also saved in separate files named with the tag name.
#
# The repeated run size option is particularly useful when making
# look-up tables and training ensembles for neural networks.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A list of numbers may be assigned to a tag in two different ways:

#
# Example: 
#
# DETECTOR_DEPTHS = 0 50e3 90e3 99999
#
# 2) TAG = <value_1>:<step>:<value_n> 
#
# Here the list starts with the number <value_1>, and the other numbers
# are <value_1> + <step>, <value_1> + 2*<step>,…, <value_1> + n*<step>
#
# Example:
#
# DETECTOR_AZIMUTH_ANGLES = -180:20:180

# Tabulated numbers, i.e. a list of x-values with corresponding
# y-values, may be assigned to a tag in this manner:
#
# TAG = <x1> <y1> 
#       <x2> <y2> 
#        ... 
#       <xn> <yn>
#  
# Unless otherwise specified, y-values corresponding to x-values in
# between the tabulated points are found by linear interpolation. 
# A table may be assigned only one y-value, which will make it 
# constant.
#
# Example: 
#
# Band widths of 1.0, 1.5, and 3.0 nm may be specified at the center
# wavelengths 400, 500, and 700 nm in this manner:
#
# DETECTOR_WAVELENGTH_BAND_WIDTHS = 400 1.0  
#                                   500 1.5
#                                   700 3.0
# 
# With this table, the wavelength band width at, say 450 nm, will 
# be 1.25, obtained by linear interpolation.
