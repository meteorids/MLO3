## AccuRT configuration file for water_impurity_ccrr material ##

# This material can only be included in the lower slab. 

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or 
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering 
# (counting downward from the top-of-the-lower-slab (TLS)) or  
# depths in meters (measured downward from the TLS) in the 
# CHLOROPHYLL_CONCENTRATION, MINERAL_CONCENTRATION and 
# CDOM_ABSORPTION_443 tags below. The layer numbering is 
# explained in detail in the main configuration file.

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The CHLOROPHYLL_CONCENTRATION tag shall be assigned the mass
# concentration [mg/m^3] of chlorophyll-a versus water depth [m]. 
# A single value will give a constant concentration with depth.

CHLOROPHYLL_CONCENTRATION  = 1 0.5

# The MINERAL_CONCENTRATION tag shall be assigned the mass
# concentration [g/m^3] of mineral particles versus water depth [m]. 

MINERAL_CONCENTRATION  = 1 0.2

# The CDOM_ABSORPTION_443 tag shall be assigned the absorption
# coefficient [1/m] versus water depth [m] of colored dissolved
# organic matter at wavelength 443 nm.

CDOM_ABSORPTION_443 = 1 0.05

# The CDOM_ABSORPTION_SLOPE tag shall be assigned a value that 
# determines the wavelength dependence of the absorption by 
# color dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The default value is 
# 0.0176. The wavelength dependence of CDOM goes like 
# exp(-CDOMS*(wv(i)-443)) where CDOMS is the assigned 
# CDOM_ABSORPTION_SLOPE and wv(i) is the wavelength in nm. 
# See water_impurity_ccrr material in the Technical Notes 
# for details.

CDOM_ABSORPTION_SLOPE = 0.0176

# The MINERAL_ABSORPTION_SLOPE tag shall be assigned a value that 
# determines the wavelength dependence of the absorption by
# mineral particles. The default value is 0.0123.
# The wavelength dependence of the mineral absorption goes like
# exp(-MINS*(wv(i)-443)) where MINS is the assigned 
# MINERAL_ABSORPTION_SLOPE and wv(i) is the wavelength in nm. 
# See water_impurity_ccrr material in the Technical Notes 
# for details.

MINERAL_ABSORPTION_SLOPE = 0.0123

# *** The HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE tag is scheduled to be implemented in
# a later version. Currently it has no effect. ***
# The HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE tag shall be assigned a default value  
# of "nan" (do nothing). If this tag is set to a value between 
# -1 and 1, then the phase function normally used for the 
# water_impurity_ccrr material will be switched off, and 
# "overriden" by the Henyey-Greenstein phase function.
# The value specified refers to the asymmetry parameter, "g".
# For example if HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE = 0.9, then g = 0.9.
# (Recall that g = -1 for complete backscattering, g = 1 for 
# complete forward scattering, and g = 0 for isotropic scattering.)
# This option may be useful for determining if the actual water 
# impurities are either more or less forward scattering than 
# specified by the water_impurity_ccrr model, which uses a 
# combination of the Petzold (for pigmented particles) and 
# Fournier-Forand (for nonalgal particles) phase functions.
# See the Technical Notes for a full description of phase 
# functions including the Henyey-Greenstein phase function.

HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE = nan

# Experimental option for adjusting UV chlorophyll absorption.
# Range: [0, 1]

CHLOROPHYLL_ABSORPTION_FACTOR = 0.5
