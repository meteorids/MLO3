# Configuration options:

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or 
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering 
# (counting downward from TOS) or depths in meters (counting downward
# from TOS) in the MATERIAL_PROFILE tag below. The layer numbering 
# is explained in detail in the main configuration file.

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The MATERIAL_PROFILE tag shall be used to specify the layer number
# (or depth) and the volume fraction occupied by the user specified
# material.

# The WAVELENGTHS tag should be assigned all user specified centre
# wavelengths [nm].

# Absorption coefficient (A_i_j) [1/m], scattering coefficient (S_i_j)
# [1/m], and phase moments (P_i_j) for each layer (or depth) i and

# be listed. Note that i and j should begin with one, not zero.

# The REFRACTIVE_INDICES tag shall be assigned a list of the real part
# of the bulk refractive index for each wavelength. Note that the
# refractive index will have no effect if this material is included in
# the upper slab.
