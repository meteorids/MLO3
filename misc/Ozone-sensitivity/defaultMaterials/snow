## AccuRT configuration file for snow material ##

# Snow grains are assumed to consist of a collection of homogeneous
# spheres with a single-mode log-normal volume size distribution
# with a specified volume mode radius (also called the mean radius  
# below) and width. The refractive index is based on the 
# compilation by Warren and Brandt (2008).
# Two options are available: (i) a fast parameterization based on 
# Mie computations (default), and (ii) a complete Mie computation. 

# See end of the main configuration file for documentation on
# how to tabulate data.

# NOTES: This snow material shall be included at 
# the bottom of the upper slab. An important parameter is the 
# snow layer geometrical thickness, which is controlled by the 
# LAYER_DEPTHS_UPPER_SLAB tag in the main configuration file. 
# (All layer geometrical thicknesses are controlled in the main 
# configuration file by the two LAYER_DEPTHS tags.) Note that by
# default there are 14 layers in the upper slab (atmosphere).
# Additional layers must be allocated at the bottom of the 
# upper slab to accommodate the snow layers.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering
# (counting downward from top-of-the-upper-slab (TUS)) or depths  
# in meters (measured downward from TUS) in the SNOW_PROFILE and 
# IMPURITY_PROFILE tags below. The layer numbering is explained 
# in detail in the main configuration file below the default 
# values for the LAYER_DEPTHS_UPPER_SLAB tag. For example, if a 
# total snow depth of 0.2 m is desired, and if layer boundaries 
# 99999.8 and 99999.9 have been added to the default layer 
# settings in the main configuration file so that layers 15 and 
# 16 (counting downward from TOS) contain snow, then snow densities 
# of 200 and and 260 kg/m^3 can be assigned to the two lowermost 
# layers in the upper slab as follows:
# SNOW_PROFILE  = 15 200
#                 16 260

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The SNOW_PROFILE tag shall be assigned tabulated snow densities 
# [kg/m^3] versus depth [m] measured from the TUS or layer 
# number, counting from the TUS.

SNOW_PROFILE  = 15 200
                16 260

# The GRAIN_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS tag shall be assigned an effective
# radius [microns] versus depth [m] measured from the TUS or
# layer number, counting from the TUS.

GRAIN_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS = 15 100
                         16 300

# The IMPURITY_PROFILE tag shall be assigned tabulated snow impurity
# fractions [unitless] versus depth [m] measured from the TOS or layer 
# number, counting from the TUS. The snow impurity fraction is the 
# volume fraction of the snow occupied by impurities. 
# Snow impurities are assumed to be absorbing, but non-scattering. 
# A single value will give a constant value of the impurity fraction 
# with depth.

IMPURITY_PROFILE = 15 1e-6
                   16 1e-7

# The IMPURITY_IMAG tag shall be assigned the imaginary part of
# the impurity refractive index [unitless] versus wavelength [nm]
# measured from the TUS or layer number, counting from the TUS. 
# A single value will give a constant index with wavelength.

IMPURITY_IMAG = 0.4

# The INTERNAL_MIXING tag shall be set to <true> or <false> 
# depending on whether the snow impurities should be distributed 
# inside or outside the snow grains, respectively.

INTERNAL_MIXING = false

# The USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE tag shall be set to <true>  
# or <false> depending on whether the Henyey-Greenstein (HG) 
# phase function will be used instead of the full Mie phase 
# function. If the tag is set to <true>, the asymmetry factor 
# of the HG phase function will be set equal to the first moment 
# of the Mie phase function, and the HG phase function will be used.

USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE = false

# The USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE tag shall be assigned <true> or
# <false> depending on whether to use the parameterizations of the
# inherent optical properties described in Stamnes et al. JQSRT 
# 2011, or a complete Mie calculation. Note that the parameterized 
# Mie version uses a Henyey-Greenstein phase function.
  
USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = true

# The SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH tag shall be assigned tabulated 
# size distribution widths [unitless] versus depth [m] measured 
# from the TUS or layer number, counting from the TUS. The size 
# distribution width is defined as the standard deviation sigma 
# of the log transformed size distribution. A single value will 
# give a constant width of the grain size distribution with depth. 
# This width is irrelevant if USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = true.
# If USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = false, then the mode radius 
# r_{n} (in number density space) of the lognormal size 
# distribution will be calculated from the effective grain radius 
# using the relationship: r_{n} = r_{eff} exp{-2.5 sigma^2}, 
# between the effective grain radius r_{eff} and the mode 
# radius r_{n} (see Eq. (25) in Technical notes).

SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH = 0.1

# The QUADRATURE_POINTS tag shall be assigned the number of
# quadrature points to be used in the numerical integration of 
# absorption and scattering coefficients over the particle size 
# distribution.
# The number of quadrature points should be an integer greater
# than 1, and should be set high enough to yield an accurate
# answer, but not too high to waste computer time.
# It is not recommended to use less than 50 quadrature points.
# This tag is only used when USE_PARAMETRIZED_MIE_CODE = false

QUADRATURE_POINTS = 50
