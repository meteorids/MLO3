## AccuRT configuration file for cloud material ##

# Clouds are assumed to consist of a collection of homogeneous
# spheres having a single-mode log-normal volume size
# distribution with a specified volume mode radius (also called 
# the mean radius below) and width. The refractive for pure 
# water is based on data data taken from the literature. The 
# refractive index of ice is based on the compilation by Warren 
# and Brandt (2008). A Mie code is used to compute the inherent 
# optical properties of cloud particles (see Technical notes 
# for details).

# See end of the main configuration file for documentation on
# how to assign values to list and table tags. 

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering
# (counting downward from top-of-the-upper-slab (TUS)) or depths  
# in meters (measured downward from TUS) in the CLOUD_PROFILE 
# tag below. The layer numbering is explained in detail in the 
# main configuration file below the default values for the 
# LAYER_DEPTHS_UPPER_SLAB tag. 

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The CLOUD_TYPE tag shall be assigned either <water> or <ice>
# depending on whether the cloud consists of liquid water droplets 
# or ice particles. A mixture of water droplets and ice particles 
# may be obtained by including one <water> cloud material and one 
# <ice> cloud material.

CLOUD_TYPE = water

# The CLOUD_PROFILE tag shall be used to specify the layer 
# number (or depth) and the volume fraction of the cloud 
# particles. For example, if one desires a cloud to be 
# included between 2000 m and 4000 m with a volume fraction of
# 1e-6, then the tags should be assigned the following values:
# PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering
# CLOUD_TYPE = water
# CLOUD_PROFILE = 13 1e-6  

CLOUD_PROFILE  = 13 1e-6

# The GRAIN_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS tag shall be assigned the volume mode 
# radius r_v [microns] of the cloud particles in each layer (or depth).

GRAIN_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS = 10 

# The SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH tag shall be assigned a value for the
# width of the volume size distribution. The width is defined as the 
# standard deviation. For a total volume V of the cloud particles and 
# mode radius r_v,let r_small and r_large denote the radii at which 
# dV/d(ln(r)) has values that are respectively half a standard 
# deviation below and above the mode radius r. Then the standard 
# deviation sigma (and thus the value of the SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH 
# tag) is given as sigma =log(r_large/r_small).

SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH = 0.2

# The USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE tag shall be assigned <true> or
# <false> depending on whether to use the parameterizations of the
# inherent optical properties described in Stamnes et al. JQSRT
# 2011, or a complete Mie calculation. Note that the parameterized
# Mie version uses a Henyey-Greenstein phase function.

USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = true

# The USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE tag shall be set to <true>  
# or <false> depending on whether the Henyey-Greenstein (HG) 
# phase function will be used instead of the full Mie phase 
# function. If the tag is set to <true>, the asymmetry factor 
# of the HG phase function will be set equal to the first moment 
# of the Mie phase function, and the HG phase function will be used.

USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE = false

# The QUADRATURE_POINTS tag shall be assigned the number of
# quadrature points to be used in the numerical integration of 
# absorption and scattering coefficients over the particle size 
# distribution.
# The number of quadrature points should be an integer greater
# than 1, and should be set high enough to yield an accurate
# answer, but not too high to waste computer time.
# It is not recommended to use less than 50 quadrature points.
# This tag is only used when USE_PARAMETRIZED_MIE_CODE = false

QUADRATURE_POINTS = 50
