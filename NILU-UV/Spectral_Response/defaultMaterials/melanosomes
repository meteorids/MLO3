# AccuRT user configuration file for melanosomes material. 

# The inherent optical properties of melanosomes are modeled as
# homogeneous spheres with a bimodal log-normal volume size
# distribution.

# See beginning of the main configuration file for documentation on
# how to assign values to list and table tags.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------
# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering
# (counting downward from skin surface) or depths in meters (counting
# downward from skin surface) in the MATERIAL_PROFILE tag below. The
# layer numbering is explained in detail in the main configuration
# file.

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The MATERIAL_PROFILE tag shall be used to specify the layer number
# (or depth) and the corresponding volume fraction filled by the
# melanosomes material.

MATERIAL_PROFILE = 1 0.10
		   2 0.10
		   3 0.0
		   4 0.0

# Ratio of amount of eu-melanin to total amount of melanin,
# i.e. euMelanin/(euMelanin+pheoMelanin)

EU_MELANIN_FRACTION = 0.05

# Imaginary part of melanin refractive index at 500 nm. 

REFRACTIVE_INDEX_IMAG_500 = 0.002

# Tabulated geometrical mean radiuses [microns] versus depth [m]
# measured from bottom of the upper slab. The geometric mean radius is
# defined as the radius where the log-normal volume size distribution
# has its maximum, i.e. the radius, r, where dV/d(ln(r)) has its
# maximum, where V is the total particle volume fraction.

SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_MEAN_RADIUSES = 1 0.1
				  2 0.3
				  3 1.0
				  4 1.0 

# Widths of the volume size distribution. The width is defined as the
# geometric standard deviation, i.e. the standard deviation of
# dV/d(ln(r)). If r_small and r_large denote the radiuses of the
# particles, half a standard deviation below and above the mean
# radius, respectively, then the standard deviation (and thus the
# SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTHS) would be given as
# sigma=log(r_large/r_small).
