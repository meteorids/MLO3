## AccuRT configuration file for vacuum material ##

# Vacuum has refractive index equal to one and no absorption and no
# scattering.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering
# (counting downward from top of slab) or depths in meters (counting downward
# from top of slab) in the MATERIAL_PROFILE tag below. The layer numbering
# is explained in detail in the main configuration file.

PROFILE_LABEL = depth_numbering

# The MATERIAL_PROFILE tag shall be used to specify the layer number
# (or depth) and corresponding volume fraction filled by vacuum. A
# single value will give a constant volume fraction with depth.

MATERIAL_PROFILE = 1
