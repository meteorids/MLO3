## AccuRT configuration file for pure_water material ##

# See end of the main configuration file for documentation on
# how to assign values to list and table tags.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or 
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering 
# (counting downward from the top-of-the-lower-slab (TLS)) or  
# depths in meters (measured downward from the TLS) in the 
# MATERIAL_PROFILE tag below. The layer numbering is 
# explained in detail in the main configuration file.

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The MATERIAL_PROFILE tag is needed for the water material if 
# materials other than pure water with significant volume are 
# included. For example, the layer number for water should be 
# MATERIAL_PROFILE = 1 0.0 
#	              2 1.0
# if a layer of ice is included at the top of the lower slab. 
# A single value will give a constant volume fraction of water 
# with depth.

MATERIAL_PROFILE = 1

# *** The SALINITY tag is scheduled to be implemented in version
# 2.0. Currently it has no effect. *** The SALINITY tag shall be
# assigned tabulated salinity [psu] versus depth [m] measured from
# bottom of upper slab. A single value gives constant salinity
# with depth.

SALINITY = 35  

# *** The TEMPERATURE tag is scheduled to be implemented in version
# 2.0. Currently it has no effect. *** 
# The TEMPERATURE tag shall be assigned tabulated temperature [K] 
# versus depth [m] measured from bottom of upper slab. A single 
# value gives constant temperature with depth.

TEMPERATURE = 290

# *** The PRESSURE tag is scheduled to be implemented in version
# 2.0. Currently it has no effect. *** 
# The PRESSURE tag shall be  assigned tabulated pressures 
# [Pa] versus depth [m] measured from the TLS. 
# A single value gives constant pressure with depth.

PRESSURE = 1.0e5
