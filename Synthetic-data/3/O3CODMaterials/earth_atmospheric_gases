## AccuRT configuration file for earth_atmospheric_gases material ##

# See end of the main configuration file for documentation on
# how to assign values to list and table tags.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The ATMOSPHERE_TYPE tag shall be assigned <tropical>,
# <mid_latitude_summer>, <mid_latitude_winter>, <sub_arctic_summer>,
# <sub_arctic_winter>, or <us_standard>.

ATMOSPHERE_TYPE = us_standard 

# The GROUND_ALTITUDE tag shall be assigned the ground surface height
# [m] above sea level.

GROUND_ALTITUDE = 0.0

# The SAVE_ATMOSPHERIC_PROFILES tag shall be assigned <true> or
# <false>, depending on whether or not the atmospheric profiles and
# equivalent depths are to be saved to atmospheric_profiles.txt in the
# material folder. This file will for example contain the default
# ozone column amount, which is needed when scaling to a given amount,
# i.e.
# F_O3=userSpecifiedEquivalentDepth/outputEquivalentDeptAtUnitScalingFactor.
# More documentation is given in the header of the saved file. Note
# that this tag is effective only when IOP_MODEL = air.

SAVE_ATMOSPHERIC_PROFILES = false

# The SEA_LEVEL_PRESSURE tag shall be assigned the atmospheric
# pressure at sea level [mbar]. Note that 1 atm pressure = 1013.25
# mbar = 1.01325 x 10^5 Pa = 1.01325 x 10^5 N/m^2. This tag is effective 
# only when IOP_MODEL = air.

SEA_LEVEL_PRESSURE = 1013 

# The IOP_MODEL tag shall be assigned <gasIop> or <air>, depending on
# the type of inherent optical properties model to be used. Note that
# with the air option only ozone will be included among the absorbing
# gases. Thus changing parameters for other gases when using the air
# model will not have any effect on the output.

IOP_MODEL = gasIop

# The F tags shall be assigned scaling factors for the atmospheric
# gases.

F_H2O     = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_CO2     = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_O3        = 7.199000e-01# Both for gasIop and air
F_N2O     = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_CO      = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_CH4     = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_O2      = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_NO      = 1.0 # Only for gasIop

F_N2      = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_H2O_CON = 1.0 # Only for gasIop
F_RAY_SCA = 1.0 # Both for gasIop and air

# spectral response function type
# 1 = rectangular, 2 = triangular, 3 = Gaussian, 4 = user specified
# If set to 4, will read from specfically crafted file "srf_gasiop.txt"
