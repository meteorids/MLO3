# AccuRT configuration file for water_impurity_gsm material.

# This material can only be included in the lower slab. 

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering
# (counting downward from water surface) or depths in meters (counting
# downward from water surface) in the CHLOROPHYLL_CONCENTRATION and
# MINERAL_CONCENTRATION tags below. The layer numbering is explained
# in detail in the main configuration file.

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The CHLOROPHYLL_CONCENTRATION tag should be assigned the mass
# concentration [mg/m^3] of chlorophyll-a versus water depth [m]. A
# single value will give constant concentration with depth.

CHLOROPHYLL_CONCENTRATION  = 1 0.5

# The PARTICULATE_BACK_SCATTERING tag should be assigned the
# BBP(443) [1/m]

PARTICULATE_BACK_SCATTERING  = 1 0.002

# The CDOM_ABSORPTION_443 tag should be assigned the absorption
# coefficient [1/m] versus water depth [m] of colored dissolved
# organic matter at the wavelength equal to 443 nm.

CDOM_ABSORPTION_443 = 1 0.05

# The CDOM_ABSORPTION_SLOPE tag shall be assigned a value that 
# determines the wavelength dependence of the absorption by 
# color dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The default value is 
# 0.0176. The wavelength dependence of CDOM goes like 
# exp(-CDOMS*(wv(i)-443)) where CDOMS is the assigned 
# CDOM_ABSORPTION_SLOPE and wv(i) is the wavelength in nm. 
# See water_impurity_ccrr material in the Technical Notes 
# for details.

CDOM_ABSORPTION_SLOPE = 0.0176

# *** The HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE tag is scheduled to be implemented in
# a later version. Currently it has no effect. ***
# The HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE tag shall be assigned a default value  
# of "nan" (do nothing). If this tag is set to a value between 
# -1 and 1, then the phase function normally used for the 
# water_impurity_gsm material will be switched off, and 
# "overriden" by the Henyey-Greenstein phase function.
# The value specified refers to the asymmetry parameter, "g".
# For example if HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE = 0.9, then g = 0.9.
# (Recall that g = -1 for complete backscattering, g = 1 for 
# complete forward scattering, and g = 0 for isotropic scattering.)
# This option may be useful for determining if the actual water 
# impurities are either more or less forward scattering than 
# specified by the water_impurity_gsm model, which uses a 
# Fournier-Forand (for nonalgal particles) phase functions.
# See the Technical Notes for a full description of phase 
# functions including the Henyey-Greenstein phase function.

HG_OVERRIDE_VALUE = nan
