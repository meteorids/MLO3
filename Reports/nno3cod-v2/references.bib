A radiative transfer model is used to simulate measurements to create the new aerosol optical depth retrieval method. A description of the algorithm, simulations, proof of principle, merits, possible future developments and implementations is provided. As a demonstration, measurements in the New York City area are simulated based on the specific channel configuration of an existing multichannel irradiance instrument.

@article{Perliski:1989,
	abstract = {Insight into the causes of the annual and semi-annual ozone oscillations may be gained from the analysis of photochemical model behavior. In this paper, the monthly variations of the ozone mixing ratio computed by the two-dimensional photochemical model of Garcia and Solomon (1983, J. geophys. Res. 88, 1379) are Fourier-analyzed and compared with SBUV observations of ozone mixing ratio. Remarkably good qualitative agreement between the model calculations and the observations is found. Analysis of computed transport and chemical production and destruction rates reveals the causes of the modelled seasonal ozone variations. It will be shown that at high latitudes and low altitudes, modelled ozone abundances increase in the winter due to transport and decrease in the summer due to chemical destruction. In the middle stratosphere, the calculated annual ozone variation is largely due to the annual variation in the odd-oxygen production rate, and in the upper stratosphere, the computed annual ozone variation is caused by the large calculated annual oscillation in temperature. Comparison between the model and observations suggests that the equatorial semi-annual oscillation above 10 mb is caused mainly by the semi-annual temperature and wind oscillation (SAO). Below 10 mb the computed equatorial ozone variation is caused by the increased rates of odd-oxygen production associated with the semi-annual zenith crossings of the Sun. Finally, the calculated polar semi-annual ozone oscillations are found to be caused by modulation of the radiatively driven middle-stratospheric ozone variation by temperature dependent chemical destruction processes.},

@article{Dahlback:1996,
	abstract = {I describe a method to derive biologically effective UV dose rates, total ozone abundances, and cloud optical depths from irradiance measurements with moderate bandwidth filter instruments that have only a few channels in the UV region. These quantities are determined when the measured irradiances are combined with radiative transfer calculations. The method was applied to a four-channel filter instrument with center wavelengths at 305, 320, 340, and 380 nm and bandwidths of 10 nm. I compared the instrument with a high-wavelength-resolution spectroradiometer during a 1-week period in San Diego, California, with variable cloudiness. The relative difference in Commission Internationale de l'\'{E}clairage (CIE)-weighted UV dose rates for solar zenith angle's (SZA's) \&lt; 80{\textdegree} was 1.4 {\textpm} 3.2\%. The relative difference for clear sky was 0.6 {\textpm} 1.5\% for SZA's \&lt; 80{\textdegree}. The total ozone inferred from the irradiance measurements with the filter instrument is insensitive to clouds. The instrument was compared with a Dobson and a Brewer instrument in Oslo, Norway, 60 {\textdegree}N, for more than 1 year. The relative difference in derived ozone abundance for the entire period, including cloudy days, was 0.3 {\textpm} 2.9\%. The standard deviation was reduced to 1.9\% when only clear sky and SZA's \&lt; 60{\textdegree} were included. By using the total ozone and the cloud optical depth derived from the filter instrument as input to a radiative transfer model, one can compute a complete spectrum from 290 to 400 nm with 1-nm resolution. Such calculated spectra are in good agreement with spectra measured simultaneously with a high-wavelength-resolution spectroradiometer for clear as well as cloudy sky conditions and can be used to determine dose rates for any desired action spectrum. Only one UV-B channel and one UV-A channel are required to compute the spectra.},

	abstract = {Combining information from several channels of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU-UV) irradiance meter, one may determine the total ozone column (TOC) amount. A NILU-UV instrument has been deployed and operated on two locations at Troll research station in Jutulsessen, Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, for several years. The method used to determine the TOC amount is presented, and the derived TOC values are compared with those obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) located on NASA's AURA satellite. The findings show that the NILU-UV TOC amounts correlate well with the results of the OMI and that the NILU-UV instruments are suitable for monitoring the long-term change and development of the ozone hole. Because of the large footprint of OMI, NILU-UV is a more suitable instrument for local measurements.},

@article{Sugawara:2014,
	abstract = {The surface albedo of two large cities in Japan was measured using a pyranometer mounted on a helicopter to avoid the bidirectional reflectance distribution. The daytime albedo was 0.12 in the cities, which was less than that of a nearby forest (0.16). The albedo was dependent on building structure in the cities; the albedo was lower in areas with more buildings, and decreased as the aspect ratio of street canyons increased. There are two reasons for this dependency: the multiple reflection of radiation in the building canopy, as has been shown in many previous studies, and the sparse vegetation in urban areas. These two factors concurrently determine the albedo in a real city, where the vegetation amount decreases as the plan roof ratio increases.},

	abstract = {We summarize an advanced, thoroughly documented, and quite general purpose discrete ordinate algorithm for time-independent transfer calculations in vertically inhomogeneous, nonisothermal, plane-parallel media. Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emissionat the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators---advances in both formulation and numerical solution---are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two ill-conditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the fortran program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},

Application of the RBF-NN method to about three years of data obtained by a NILU-UV device, which is a multi-channel, moderate bandwidth filter instrument, revealed that compared to the traditional Look-up table (LUT) method, the RBF-NN method yielded better agreement with a 1\% decrease in relative difference and an increase of 0.03 in correlation with total ozone column (TOC) values obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Furthermore, the RBF-NN method retrieved more valid results (daily average values within a meaningful range (200--500 DU)) than the LUT method. Compared with RBF-NN retrievals, TOC values obtained from the OMI are underestimated under cloudy conditions. This finding agrees with conclusions reached by Anton and Loyola (2011).},
